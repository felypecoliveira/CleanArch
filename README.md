# 🧱 Clean Architecture - First Attempt

This repository contains my **first attempt at implementing Clean Architecture** in a project. 
The goal is to learn, explore, and internalize the core principles of this architectural approach, focusing on separation 
of concerns, testability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 📚 About the Project

Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), is a way of organizing code that emphasizes 
independence from frameworks, UI, databases, and external agencies. 
The system is built around business rules, keeping them isolated from implementation details.
This project is a sandbox for experimentation and learning, not a production-ready solution.

## 🧩 Structure Overview

The project follows a layered structure inspired by Clean Architecture:

- **Entities** – Enterprise-wide business rules.
- **Use Cases / Interactors** – Application-specific business rules.
- **Interface Adapters** – Presenters, controllers, gateways.
- **Frameworks & Drivers** – External tools like web frameworks, DBs, etc.

> Note: The structure may be simplified or adjusted as I refine my understanding.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a **work in progress**. I'm still learning and may change things as I discover better ways to organize the code.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Language: (e.g., Python / Java / C# / TypeScript)
- Frameworks: (if any, e.g., FastAPI / .NET / Spring Boot)
- Testing: (e.g., pytest, JUnit)

## ✅ Goals

Study Clean Architecture concepts:

. Implement basic domain logic
. Add unit and integration tests
. Improve folder structure
. Document design decisions

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions, feedback, and insights are welcome!
